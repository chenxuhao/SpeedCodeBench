Implementation of a Sparse-Matrix Dense-Vector Product, i.e., A*x=y, 
where input A is a sparse matrix, input x is a dense vector, and the output y is a dense vector.  

The input file is a sparse matrix in [Compressed Sparse Row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) (CSR) format.
The output is a dense vector.
