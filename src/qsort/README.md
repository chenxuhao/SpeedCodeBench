[Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) is an efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm.

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. 
It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array 
and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays,
according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
