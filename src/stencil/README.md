Iterative Stencil Loops (ISLs) are a class of numerical data processing solution 
which update array elements according to some fixed pattern, called a stencil. 
They are most commonly found in computer simulations, e.g. for computational fluid dynamics in the context of scientific and engineering applications.
Other notable examples include solving partial differential equations,[1] the Jacobi kernel, the Gaussâ€“Seidel method, image processing and cellular automata.
The regular structure of the arrays sets stencil techniques apart from other modeling methods such as the Finite element method.
Most finite difference codes which operate on regular grids can be formulated as ISLs.

This program defines a 3D grid of size 128x128x32 and applies the 7-point stencil operation to it.
The stencil function takes two pointers to double arrays **A<sub>0</sub>** and **A<sub>next</sub>**, representing the input and output grids respectively. 
The stencil operation is performed on each point of the input grid using the neighboring points, 
and the result is stored in the corresponding point of the output grid. 

In the main function, the input grid **A<sub>0</sub>** is initialized with an input file, 
and then the stencil function is called with **A<sub>0</sub>** and a pointer to an empty output grid **A<sub>next</sub>**. 
This process is repeated with multiple iterations, by switching the pointers to **A<sub>0</sub>** and **A<sub>next</sub>** after every iteration.
Finally, the values of **A<sub>next</sub>** are printed to an output file to verify the correctness of the stencil operation.
