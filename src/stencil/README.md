This program defines a 3D grid of size 100x100x100 and applies the 7-point stencil operation to it using OpenCilk's cilk_for loop construct. 
The stencil function takes two pointers to double arrays u and v, representing the input and output grids respectively. 
The stencil operation is performed on each point of the grid using the neighboring points, 
and the result is stored in the corresponding point of the output grid. 
The inv_denom variable stores the inverse of the denominator of the stencil formula, which is 7 in this case.

In the main function, the input grid u is initialized with some values, 
and then the stencil function is called with u and a pointer to an empty output grid v. 
Finally, some values of v are printed to verify the correctness of the stencil operation.
