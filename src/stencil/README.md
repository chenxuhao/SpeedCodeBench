This program defines a 3D grid of size 128x128x32 and applies the 7-point stencil operation to it.
The stencil function takes two pointers to double arrays A0 and Anext, representing the input and output grids respectively. 
The stencil operation is performed on each point of the grid using the neighboring points, 
and the result is stored in the corresponding point of the output grid. 

In the main function, the input grid A0 is initialized with an input file, 
and then the stencil function is called with u and a pointer to an empty output grid Anext. 
Finally, values of Anext are printed to an output file to verify the correctness of the stencil operation.
