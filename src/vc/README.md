In graph theory, [graph coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) is a special case of graph labeling; 
it is an assignment of labels traditionally called "colors" to elements of a graph subject to certain constraints. 
In its simplest form, it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are of the same color;
this is called a vertex coloring. Similarly, an edge coloring assigns a color to each edge so that no two adjacent edges are of the same color.
