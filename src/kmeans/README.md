[k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) is a method of vector quantization, 
originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs 
to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.
