In numerical linear algebra, the [Gaussâ€“Seidel method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method), 
also known as the Liebmann method or the method of successive displacement, 
is an iterative method used to solve a system of linear equations. 
It is named after the German mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel, 
and is similar to the Jacobi method. Though it can be applied to any matrix with non-zero elements on the diagonals, 
convergence is only guaranteed if the matrix is either strictly diagonally dominant, or symmetric and positive definite.
