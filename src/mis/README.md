## Maximal Independent Set (MIS)

Given a undirected graph return a maximal independent set for the graph. 
The input graph can be in any format (as long as it does not encode the MIS somehow). 
Also the code cannot reorder the graph for locality. 
The output needs to be a sequence of the vertices appearing in the MIS. It need not be in sorted order.

## Input and Output File Formats

The input is a graph in the in the CSR format.
The output is a vector of vertex ids corresponding to the locations of all vertices in the MIS (0 based).i
