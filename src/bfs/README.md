## BFS

Kernel: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Will return distance (or parent) array for a BFS traversal from a source vertex

This BFS implementation makes use of the Direction-Optimizing approach [1].
It uses the alpha and beta parameters to determine whether to switch search
directions. For representing the frontier, it uses a SlidingQueue for the
top-down approach and a Bitmap for the bottom-up approach. To reduce
false-sharing for the top-down approach, thread-local QueueBuffer's are used.

To save time computing the number of edges exiting the frontier, this
implementation precomputes the degrees in bulk at the beginning by storing
them in parent array as negative numbers. Thus the encoding of parent is:
  parent[x] < 0 implies x is unvisited and parent[x] = -out_degree(x)
  parent[x] >= 0 implies x been visited
