The [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), 
also known as the Jaccard similarity coefficient, is a statistic used for gauging the similarity and diversity of sample sets. 
It computes the ratio of Intersection over Union. 
The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, 
and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets:
