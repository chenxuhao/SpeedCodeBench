Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a technique used for finding approximate nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces.
In this technique, similar items are hashed to the same buckets with high probability.
OpenMP is a powerful tool for parallelizing code to run on shared memory systems.
We can use OpenMP to speed up the LSH algorithm by parallelizing the hash function computation.

In this program, we define the dimension of the data vectors (DIMENSION), 
the number of vectors (NUM_VECTORS), and the number of buckets (NUM_BUCKETS). 
We generate random data vectors using the rand() function and compute hash values for each vector using the hash_function() function. 
We then increment the count for the corresponding bucket using an OpenMP atomic operation to ensure correctness in a parallel setting.
